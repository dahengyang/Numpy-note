# Numpy Note


## 1. basics


### 1.1 type
  * numpy has its own datatypes.

    + float: `np.float16`, `np.float32`, `np.float64`
    + int: `np.int8`, `np.int16`, `np.int32`,`np.int64`
    + unsigned_int: `np.uint8`, `np.uint16`, `np.uint32`,`np.uint64`
    + complex: `np.complex64`, `np.complex128`
    + bool: `np.bool`
    + byte: `np.byte`, signed char `np.ubyte`: unsigned char
    + more conventioned name from C: `np.short`, `np.long`, `np.double` etc.
  * all above datatype can be used as function to convert type
    `np.float32(1.0)`

  * like pandas, for given `np.array.astype('str')` convert types

  * `np.ndarray.view(dtype = None)`: create a new view of the same data.

    + a.view(some_dtype) or a.view(dtype=some_dtype)
      constructs a view of the arrayâ€™s memory with a different data-type. This can cause a   reinterpretation of the bytes of memory.

    + a.view(ndarray_subclass) or a.view(type=ndarray_subclass)
      just returns an instance of ndarray_subclass that looks at the same array (same shape, dtype, etc.) This does not cause a reinterpretation of the memory.


### 1.2 arrays:
  * numpy's basic object is `np.ndarray`

  * Common ways to build array:

    + from built-in python array_like object, use `np.array()`

    + numpy function to create arrays:

      * `np.zeros(size, dtype)`: zero array

      * `np.arange([start,]stop,[step,], dtype)`: syntax like `range()` but create corresponding array

      * `np.linspace(start,stop,num=50,endpoint= True,retsetp=False,dtype,axis=0)`: numpy version of matlab linspace

        + `start=`, `stop=`: beginning and end point

        + `num`: int, number of points

        + `endpoint`: bool, if include `stop`

        + `retsetp`: bool, if true, return a tuple `(array,step)`

        + `axis`: axis to expand result. relevant only if `start`, `stop` are ndarray themselves.

      * `np.indices(dimensions, dtype, sparse)`: return indices along all     
        axies. Specifically, if the `dimensions = (d0,d1,...,d_n-1)`, the result
        is a `np.ndarray` with shape `(n,d0,d1,....d_n-1)`. The first dimension determines the axis for which indices are provided.

      Example: (See also [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32271331/can-anybody-explain-me-the-numpy-indices))
        ```python
        np.indices((2, 3))
        array([[[0, 0, 0],
                [1, 1, 1]], # row index
               [[0, 1, 2],  # column index
                [0, 1, 2]]])
        ```

    + other numpy functions' result, like functions in the `random` module below.

### 1.3 access array
  Accessor method takes an array_like object to access part of data. It can be any array_like object other than tuple, which is reserved for special use.

  There is no single index for multidimensional array as in matlab.

  * basic accessor is bracket `np.ndarray[]`.

    + accept single integer, can be positive/negative, `a[-1]`

    + accept multidimensional index in the same bracket, `a[2,3]`
      if length of number < array dims, return subarray

    + For 2d array, `a[2,3] == a[2][3]` but the former is more efficient,
      just like in `pandas`

    + range slice works as expected, `a[:-1]` means exclude the last element.
      Note that it provide new view of data but not new copy

  * array accept index arrays like matlab, `ndarray[index_array]`, this returns copy of data, this is one of the advanced indexing

    + for 1d array: return a new array of mapping: `index` -> `element`
      the index array can be multidimensional

    + for nd array: used less. Suppose array shape is (d0,d1,...d_n-1).
      The syntax should be `ndarray[index_array_1,index_array_2,...]`, to select certain dimension fully, use `:`

      * if each index array has the same shape `x` (shape match) and there are n index arrays. The result is an array of shape `x` with mapping
      `ndarray[index_1,index_2,..index_n]` -> `element`

      * if the index array does not have the same shape, numpy attempts broadcasting the match the shape

      * if there are l < n index arrays (partial indexing): the omitting axis's elements are all selected. `y[np.array([0,2,4])]` selects the 1,3,5 row of the 2d array y.

  * array accepts boolean array, leads to new copy of data. this is the other one of the advanced indexing

    + if boolean array has the same shape as the input array. It returns 1d array with elements of true. This is equivalent to `y[np.nonzero(bool_array)]`

    + if boolean array has less dimension than the array, The result dim are all selected. The returned array has shape [# of true element, omitted dims]
    Note that any selected dimension should have the same shape between input array and index bool array.

    For example, using a 2-D boolean array of shape (2,3) with four True elements to select rows from a 3-D array of shape (2,3,5) results in a 2-D result of shape (4,5). But a 2-D boolean array of shape (2,4) is invalid

  * `np.newaxis` can be used to expand array. For example

    ```python
    y = np.arange(35).reshape(5,7)
    y[:,np.newaxis,:].shape # 5,1,7
    ```

  * `...` may be used to indicate selecting in full any remaining unspecified dimensions.

    ```python
    y = np.arange(30).reshape(1,1,2,3,5)
    y[0,...,1,1].shape # 1,2
    ```  

  * all access methods if used in assignment changes original data.

    ```python
    >>> x = np.arange(0, 50, 10)
    >>> x
    array([ 0, 10, 20, 30, 40])
    >>> x[np.array([1, 1, 3, 1])] += 1
    >>> x
    array([ 0, 11, 20, 31, 40])
    ```
    Where people expect that the 1st location will be incremented by 3. In fact, it will only be incremented by 1. The reason is because a new array is extracted from the original (as a temporary) containing the values at 1, 1, 3, 1, then the value 1 is added to the temporary, and then the temporary is assigned back to the original array. Thus the value of the array at x[1]+1 is assigned to x[1] three times, rather than being incremented 3 times.

  * tuple when supplied is not interpreted as an index array but a list of indices, i.e. indicate single element access described in the first section. `a[(1,1)] == a[1,1]`

### 1.4 array methods:

  Shape manipulation
  * `ndarray.shape`: attribute, shapes of the array

  * `np.reshape(array,newshape, order = {'C','F','A'})`: reshape, return new view whenever possible.

    + `newshape` is a tuple
    + `order` specifies how ndarray is arranged in memory, row-major('C') or column major ('F')

    + also available as `ndarray.reshape()`

  * `ndarray.flat`: 1d iterator over array, a `numpy.flattier` instance
  * `ndarray.flatten(order = )`: collapse data into 1d array


  Transpose

  * `ndarray.T`: transpose of array

  * `np.transpose(array, axes=)`: permute dimensions. by default, reverse dimensions.

    + `axes =`: list of int, order of axes, starting from 0

  * `np.swapaxes(array, axis1,axis2)`: swap axes,

  * `np.moveaxis(a,start,dest)`: move axis at `start` to `dest`, keep other axes' relative orders intact.

  Change Dimension:

  * `ndarray.ndims`: attribute, number of dims

  * `np.expand_dims(array, axis)`: add dimension at location

  * `np.squeeze(array, axis)`: remove dims with size 1

    + `axis =`: if not specified, remove all.

  * `np.broadcast_to(array,shape)`: broadcast array to new shape

  * `np.broadcast_arrays(array1,array2,...)`: broad cast to make all arrays match. return list of arrays

  Stack and merge
  * `numpy.concatenate(list of arrays,axis= 0)`: concatenate array1,array2,... along axis

  * `numpy.stack(list of arrays, axis = 0)`: join arrays along a new axis


  Tiling arrays
  * `np.tile(array,reps)`: if `reps = [x0,x1,...,x_n-1]`repeat array in ith dimension for `x_i` times.
    + if `array.ndims < n`: prepend new axis to array to match n. So a shape (3,) array is promoted to (1, 3) for 2-D replication, or shape (1, 1, 3) for 3-D replication.

    + if `array.ndims > n`: prepend reps with 1 to match `array.ndims`.for an A of shape (2, 3, 4, 5), a reps of (2, 2) is treated as (1, 1, 2, 2).

  * `np.repeat(array,repeats, axis=None)`: repeat array along a single axis.

    + if `axis = None`, use `array.flatten()`as input, return 1d array

    + `repeats =`: int, number of repetition

  Add and remove elements

  * `np.unique(array,...)`: find unique elements. merge `df.value_counts()`, `df.nunique` and other functions

    + `return_index =`: bool, return indices of input array that give unique value

    + `return_inverse =`: bool, return indices of unique array to reconstruct original array. `unique_array[inverse_index]` = `original_array`.

    + `return_counts`: counts of frequency for each unique value

    + `axis`: axis to operate on, if `=None`,flatten array first. if specific axis, along that axis, flatten all subarrays.

    + return tuple of `(unique_array, indice, indice_inverse, counts)`

  * `np.trim_zeros(1darray,trim = {'f','b','fb'})`: trim front and back zeros of given 1 d array.

  * `np.delete(array, obj, axis = )`: return a new array where along new `axis` subarrays indexed by list of integers `obj` are removed.

  * `np.insert(array, obj, axis = )`: opposite of `np.delete`



## 2. random module
  Random module is used to generate random samples from various distributions

### 2.1 random sampling from uniform/normal
  * to generate random sample
    use `np.random` module

  * `random.rand(d0,d1,...,dn)`:
    random sampling from uniform
    distribution of [0,1] with shape [d0, d1,...,dn]

  * `random.randn(d0,d1,..,dn)`:
    random sampling from standard normal

  * `random.randint(low =, high =, size =)`:
    random sampling from uniform integer distribution. Right end is excluded. [low,high)

    + `low`: int, if `high = None`, this is the maximal integer. draw from [1,low], otherwise
    from [low, high]
    + `high`: int, the maximum

    + `size`: list/tuple, shape of np.array

  * `random.random_integers(low= ,high= ,size= )`: (deprecated)
    similar to `randint`, but both ends are inclusive. [low,high]

  * `random.random_sample(size)`: uniform from half-open interval [0,1),  
    similar to `rand` but accepts tuple. Equivalent to `random.random(size)`,
    `random.ranf(size)`,`random.sample(size)`.

  * `random.choice(a= , size= , replace =, p =)`: select from 1d array `a`, with
    given probability `p`, allow replacement if `replace = True`

    + `a`: 1d array-like object
    + `p`: 1d array-like object, if not given, assume uniform


### 2.2 permutation
  * `random.shuffle(x):` shuffle array-like `x` along first axis. The modification is inplace
    ```python
    >>> arr = np.arange(9).reshape((3, 3))
    >>> np.random.shuffle(arr)
    >>> arr
    array([[3, 4, 5],
           [6, 7, 8],
           [0, 1, 2]])    
    ```
  * `random.permutation(x):` similar to `random.shuffle()`, but make a copy and return result
    ```python
    >>> arr = np.arange(9).reshape((3, 3))
    >>> np.random.permutation(arr)
    array([[6, 7, 8],
           [0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5]])    
    ```

### 2.3 Seed control
  There are two ways to work with set seed.

  1. Set the global seed. Use `random.seed(int)`.
    ```python
    np.random.seed(0)
    np.rand()
    np.random.seed(0)
    np.rand() # should be the same result
    ```

  2. Create a container `random.RandomState(seed=int)` to fix seed for
    this particular container. Use member methods to generate random sample.
    For example `RandomState(1000).randint(0,1,[10])`, all functions covered in
    section [2.2](#2-1-random-sampling-from-uniform-normal) are available in the object's memeber methods.
    ```python
    container_A = random.RandomState(10)
    container_A.randn(10)
    container_B = random.RandomState(100)
    container_B.randn(100)    
    ```
    Useful for managing multiple seeds.

### 2.4 Other distributions
  There are other distributions like `logistic()`, `beta()`, `binominal()` and
  `poisson()`. The syntaxs are similar. Consists of `(distribution_para, size)`

  I list some here:

  * `standard_normal(size)`
  * `standard_t(size)`
  * `f(dfnum =,dfden =,size)`: `dfnum` is for numerator. `dfden` is for denominator
  * `lognormal(mean,sigma,size)`:
  * `uniform([low,high,size])`: half-open interval [low,high), float


## 3 Advanced mechanism

### 3.1 memory layout

  * An instance of class `ndarray` consists of a contiguous one-dimensional segment of computer memory (owned by the array, or by some other object), combined with an indexing scheme that maps N integers into the location of an item in the block.

### 3.2 view and copy

  * simple selection/slicing returns view of data. indexing based on index array /boolean array returns copy of data.
  See example below

  ```python
  Z = np.zeros(9)
  Z_view = Z[0:3] # simple selection
  Z_view[...] = 1
  print(Z) # [1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

  Z = np.zeros(9)
  Z_copy = Z[[0,1,2]] # advanced index
  Z_copy[...] = 1
  print(Z) # [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
  ```
  * to check if the result is a view or copy use `.base` to return the orginal data and `is` to check

  ```python
  Z = np.random.uniform(0,1,(5,5))
  Z1 = Z[:3,:]
  Z2 = Z[[0,1,2], :]
  Z1.base is Z # True
  Z2.base is Z # False
  Z2.base is None # True
  ```

  * See function's document for whether a view or copy is returned

    + `np.reshape()` return new view whenever possible

    + `np.flatten()` returns new copy


  * In arithmetic calculations between arrays, temporary copies are implicitly made. If arrays are big, think about other possible ways. For example, use `np.add/minus/...(,out=)` the keyword `out=` specifies the output numpy array, if the intermediate result need not to be saved, we can speed up slightly via coding the intermediate result with `out` on the same `ndarray`.
